# Python-Selenium-Facebook-group-auto-poster
A Python script use Selenium to achieve automatically posting images with text on multiple Facebook groups that you are the member of.

Setup
----------
 - Change facebook setting: 
   1. change to [classic view](https://www.facebook.com/help/645404059595478)
   2. [Disable 2 step authetnication](https://www.alphr.com/facebook/1006409/two-factor-authentication-2FA-facebook)

 - First of all, install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) into your machine. I used python 3.7

 - Install PIP & install selenium:
   ```
	python3.7  get-pip.py		
	pip3.7 install selenium
   ```	

 - Check [version of google chrome](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-version-of-google-chrome-do-i-have). I used chrome version 83.0.4103.97.

 - Download the [Chrome Driver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) and place it in the same directory with the script. Make sure chromedriver is same version as google chrome.
`   I used [Link](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=83.0.4103.39/).
	If you are using 83.0.4103.39 chromedriver then no need to run this it is already downloaded and stored.

    groups_links_list = [
        "https://www.facebook.com/groups/sample1", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/sample2"
    ]

    # Set up text content to post
    message = "Checkout an amazing selenium script for posting automaticaaly on Facebook groups! https://github.com/ethanXWL/Python-Selenium-Facebook-group-poster"

    # Set up paths of images to post
